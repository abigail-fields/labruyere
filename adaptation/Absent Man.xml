               for a wife&emdash;Mr. Shatterbrain accepts the proposal,
               and, in short, the happy day arrives, in which 
               he is to be put in possession of the amiable object; 
               when, behold you, the Doctor coming to call on his
               destined son-in-law, presto, pass and gone, the
               bird is flown; my gentleman is not to be found&emdash;

                     therefore, you must not be surprised if my master 
                     happens to labour under a very violent fit of his
                     out of the way malady, at this present moment.</p></sp>
