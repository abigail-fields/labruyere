         NUMB. LXXVII
         THE SPECTATOR. 
         Non convivere licet, nec Urbe tota 
         Quisquam est tam propè tam proculq; nobis. Mart.
         Tuesday, May 29, 1711.
         My friend WILL. HONEYCOMBE is 
         one of those Sort of Men who are very of-
         ten absent in Conversation, and what the 
         French call a reveur and a distrait. A 
         little before our Club-time last Night, we were walk- 
         ing together in Somerset Garden, where WILL had 
         picked up a small Pebble of so odd a make, that he 
         said he would present it to a Friend of his, an eminent 
         Virtuoso. After we had walked some time, I made 
         a full stop with my Face towards the West, which 
         WILL. knowing to be my usual Method of asking 
         what's o'Clock, in an Afternoon, immediately pulled 
         out his Watch, and told me we had seven Minutes 
         good. We took a turn or two more, when, to my 
         great Surprize I saw him squirr away his Watch a 
         considerable way into the Thames, and with great Se-
         dateness in his Looks put up the Pebble, he had 
         before found, in his fob. As I have naturally an 
         Aversion to much Speaking, and do not love to be 
         the Messenger of Ill News, especially when it comes 
         too late to be useful, I left him to be convinced of 
         his mistake in due time, and continued my Walk, 
         reflecting on these little Absences and Distractions in
         Mankind, and resolving to make them the Subject
         of a future Speculation. 
            I was the more confirmed in my Design, when I 
         considered that they were very often Blemishes in the 
         Characters of Men of Excellent Sense; and helped 
         to keep up the Reputation of that Latin proverb,
         which Mr. Dryden has Translated in the following 
         Lines: 
         Great Wit to Madness Sure is near ally'd, 
         And thin Partitions do their Bounds divide. 
           My reader does, I hope, perceive, that I distin-
         guish a man who is Absent, because he thinks of some-
         thing else, from one who is Absent because he thinks 
         of nothing at all: The latter is too Innocent a Crea-
         ture to be taken notice of; but the Distractions of 
         the former may, I believe, be generally accounted 
         for from one of these Reasons.
           Either their Minds are wholly fixed on some par-
         ticular Science, which is often the Case of Mathe-
         maticians and other Learned Men; or are wholly 
         taken up with some violent Passion, such as Anger, 
         Fear, or Love, which ties the Mind to some distant 
         Object; or, lastly, these Distractions proceed from a 
         certain Vivacity and Fickleness in a Man's Temper, 
         which, while it raises up infinite Numbers of Idea's 
         in the Mind, is continually pushing it on, with-
         out allowing it to rest on any particular Image. 
         Nothing therefore is more unnatural than the 
         Thoughts and Conceptions of such a Man, which are 
         seldom occasioned either by the Company he is in, 
         or any of those Objects which are placed before 
         him. While you fancy he is Admiring a Beautiful 
         Woman, 'tis an even Wager that he is solving a Pro-
         position in Euclid; and while you may imagine he 
         is reading the Paris Gazette, 'tis far from being imp-
         ossible that he is pulling down and rebuilding the 
         Front of his Country-House. 
           At the same time that I am endeavouring to ex-
         pose this Weakness in others, I shall readily confess 
         that I once laboured under the same Infirmity my 
         self. The Method I took to Conquer it was a firm 
         Resolution to learn something from whatever I was 
         obliged to see or hear. There is a way of Thinking, 
         if a Man can attain to it, by which he may strike 
         somewhat out of any thing. I can at present ob- 
         serve those Starts of good Sense and Struggles of un-
         improved Reason in the Conversation of a Clown, 
         with as much Satisfaction as the most shining Periods 
         of the most finished Orator; and can make a shift to 
         command my Attention at a Puppet-Show or an 
         Opera, as well as at Hamlet or Othello. I always 
         make one of the Company I am in ; for though I 
         say little myself, my Attention to others, and those 
         Nods of Approbation which I never bestow unme-
         rited, sufficiently show that I am among them. 
         Whereas WILL. HONEYCOMBE, tho' a Fellow 
         of good Sense, is every Day doing and saying an 
         hundred Things, which he afterwards confesses, with 
         a well-bred Frankness, were somewhat mal a propos, 
         and undesigned.
           I chanced the other Day to go into a Coffee-house, 
         where WILL. was standing in the midst of several
         Auditors whom he had gathered around him, and 
         was giving them an Account of the Person and 
         Character of Moll Hinton. My Appearance be-
         fore him just put him in mind of me, without 
         making him reflect that I was actually present. 
         So that keeping his Eyes full upon me, to the great 
         Surprize of his Audience, he broke off his first Ha-
         rangue, and proceeded thus,-—‘ Why now there's 
         ' my Friend (mentioning me by Name) he is a Fel-
         ' low that thinks a great deal, but never opens his 
         ' Mouth; I warrant you he is now thrusting his short 
         ' Face into some Coffee-house about 'Change. I was 
         ' his Bail in the time of the Popish-Plot, when he was 
         ' taken up for a Jesuit.' If he had looked on me a 
         little longer, he had certainly described me so particu-
         larly, without ever considering what led him into it, 
         that the whole Company must necessarily have found 
         me out; for which reason, remembering the old Pro-
         verb, Out of sight out of mind, I left the Room; 
         </pb>
         <pb>
         and upon meeting him an Hour afterwards, was 
         asked by him, with a great deal of good Humour, 
         in what Part of the World I had lived, that he had 
         not seen me these three Days. 
           Monsieur Bruyere has given us the Character of 
         an absent Man, with a great deal of Humour, which 
         he has pushed to an agreeable Extravagance; with 
         the Heads of it I shall conclude my present Paper. 
          ‘ Menalcas (says that excellent author) comes 
         ' down in a Morning, opens his Door to go out, 
         ' but shuts it again, because he perceives that he has 
         ' his Night-cap on; and, examining himself further 
         ' finds that he is but half shaved, that he has 
         ' stuck his Sword on his right side, that his Stock-
         ' ings are about his Heels, and that his Shirt is 
         ' over his Breeches. When he is dress'd, he goes 
         ' to Court, comes into the Drawing-room, and 
         ' walking bolt upright under a branch of Candle-
         ' sticks his Wigg is caught up by one of them, and 
         ' hangs dangling in the Air. All the Courtiers 
         ' fall a laughing, but Menalcas laughs louder than 
         ' any of them, and looks about for the Person that 
         ' is the Jest of the Company. Coming down to 
         ' the Court-gate he finds a Coach, which taking for 
         ' his own, he whips into it, and the Coachman 
         ' drives off, not doubting but he carries his Ma-
         ' ster. As soon as he stops, Menalcas throws 
         ' himself out of the Coach, crosses the Court, as-
         ' cends the Stair-case, and runs thro' all the Cham-
         ' bers with the greatest Familiarity, reposes him-
         ' self on a Couch, and fancies himself at home. 
         ' The Master of the House at last comes in, Me-
         ' nalcas rises to receive him, and desires him to 
         ' sit down; he talks, muses, and then talks again. 
         ' The Gentleman of the House is tired and ama-
         ' zed; Menalcas is no less so, but is every Moment 
         ' in hopes that his impertinent Guest will at last end 
         ' his tedious Visit. Night comes on, when Menal=
         ' cas is hardly undeceived. 
            ' When he is playing at bBckgammon, he calls 
         ' for a full Glass of Wine and Water; 'tis his turn 
         ' to throw, he has the Box in one Hand, and his 
         ' Glass in the other, and being extremely dry, and 
         ' unwilling to lose Time, he swallows down both 
         ' the Dice, and at the same time throws his Wine 
         ' into the Tables. He writes a Letter, and flings 
         ' the Sand into the Ink-bottle; he writes a second, 
         ' and mistakes the Superscription : A Noble-man 
         ' receives one of them, and upon opening it reads 
         ' as follows. I would have you, honest Jack, imme-
         ' diately on the Receipt of this, take in Hay enough 
         ' to serve me the Winter. His farmer receives the 
         ' other, and is amazed to see in it, My lord, I re-
         ' ceived your Grace's Commands, with an intire Sub-
         ' mission to--  If he is at an Entertainment, you 
         ' may see the Pieces of Bread continually multiply-
         ' ing around his Plate: 'Tis true the rest of the 
         ' Company want it, as well as their Knives and 
         ' Forks, which Menalcas does not let them keep 
         ' long. Sometimes in a Morning he puts his whole 
         ' Family in a hurry, and at last goes out without 
         ' being able to stay for his Coach or Dinner; and 
         ' for that Day you may see him in every part of the 
         ' Town, except the very Place where he had ap-
         ' pointed to be upon a Business of Importance. You 
         ' would often take him for every thing that he is 
         ' not; for a Fellow quite Stupid, for he hears no-
         ' thing; for a Fool, for he talks to himself, and has 
         ' an hundred Grimaces and Motions with his Head, 
         ' which are altogether involuntary; for a proud 
         ' Man, for he looks full upon you, and takes no 
         ' notice of your Saluting him: The Truth on't is, 
         ' his Eyes are open, but he makes no use of them, 
         ' and neither sees you, nor any Man, nor any thing 
         ' else. He came once from his Country-house, and 
         ' his own Footmen undertook to rob him, and 
         ' succeeded; They held a Flambeau to his Throat, 
         ' and bid him deliver his Purse; he did so, and 
         ' coming home told his Friends he had been rob-
         ' bed; they desired to know the Particulars. Ask my 
         ' Servants, says Menalcas, for they were with 
         ' me.
